# HTTP over Ã˜MQ 

This project will probably go down in history as worst idea ever, but hey, zeromq services are fun
and we needed async http requests, which node is kinda good at.

## Disclaimer

Firewall it. Don't make it accessible from the interwebs.

Change the default port, 23479 is a bit too obvious.

## Installing

Make sure you have libev and zeromq 2.x installed, then go clone [zeromq.node](https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node),
because the node 0.6 support hasn't hit the npm just yet, then be all

    npm install path/to/zeromq.node

## Using

Read the source, luke, it's not that hard!
